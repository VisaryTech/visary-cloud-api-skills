# Calendar API

Use this skill when you need to work with VIS Calendar strictly through Swagger documentation.

## Runtime Preflight

Before opening indexes or making API calls, verify that Python is available. If it is unavailable, stop and report that Python is required. Do not use fallback tools or handwritten HTTP requests.

Skill artifacts:

- `assets/index/manifest.json` - the only entry point into runtime indexes.
- `api.py` - the short CLI entry point from the skill root.

Model note:

- Each domain index in `assets/index/*.json` contains its own `model` section.
- Swagger does not publish response fields or example payloads for calendar reads.
- `assets/index/calendar.json` contains fields observed from a live `GET /calendar` response and should be treated as runtime-confirmed rather than Swagger-derived.
- `assets/index/event.json` contains fields observed from live `GET /event` and `GET /event/{id}` responses.
- `assets/index/permission.json` contains fields observed from a live `PATCH /calendar/{id}` response when a non-empty `Permissions` array was sent.

Rules:

- Swagger/OpenAPI Calendar is the only source of truth.
- Before any call, open `assets/index/manifest.json` first.
- Use only commands and fields that exist in indexes generated from Swagger.
- If a field is missing in Swagger, do not invent it.
- Do not invent high-level scenarios unless they map to a concrete documented endpoint.
- The client always gets an access token through `client_credentials`.
- Base URL resolution uses only `VIS_API_BASE_URL + "/calendar"`.
- REST query parameters and JSON body fields use `camelCase` exactly as shown in Swagger.
- Swagger exposes generic object bodies for create and update operations. Treat payload shape as unknown unless the user provides it or another trusted source documents it.
- `POST /calendar/import/{id}` requires `--file <path>` with multipart upload.
- `GET /calendar/export/{id}` can write the response body to disk through `--output <path>`.
- `PATCH /calendar/{id}` behaves like a replace-style update in practice; omitting `Alias` cleared it in a live probe.
- `PATCH /calendar/{id}` echoes a typed `Permissions` collection in the response when the request body includes it, even when a subsequent `GET /calendar/{id}` still returns `Permissions: null`.
- `PATCH /event` enforces optimistic concurrency; a body without the current `RowVersion` returned `ERROR_UpdateConcurrencyException`.
- Calendar event bodies are patched into `Visary.Calendars.Entities.Event` on the server, not into a DTO contract.
- Event payloads therefore need entity-compatible nested collections: `Users` items use `UserId`, `Groups` items use `GroupId`, and `Notifications` items use `NotificationTime`.
- The CLI normalizes common shorthand event payloads such as `calendarId`, `users: [1,3]`, `groups: [7]`, and `notifications: [15,30]` into the server-compatible shape before sending the request.

Workflow:

1. Verify that Python is available. If it is unavailable, stop immediately.
2. Open `assets/index/manifest.json`.
3. Select the relevant compact index only through entries listed in `assets/index/manifest.json`.
4. Find the required endpoint by `key` or `summary`.
5. Take the `cliShape` field from the matched entry.
6. Use the command from `cliShape`.
7. If Swagger does not contain the required endpoint or there is no matching index entry, report that explicitly and stop.

Documented query parameters:

- `GET /event`: `calendarId`, `start`, `end`
- `GET /permission`: `calendarId`
- `GET /calendar/export/{id}`: `start`, `end`, `fileName`

Swagger limitations:

- Most Calendar endpoints do not publish concrete response schemas.
- Create and update bodies are generic JSON objects with unknown field shape.
- Do not invent request fields. Reuse only fields explicitly provided by the user or by another trusted source.

Use the short shell entry point `api.py` from the skill root.

CLI examples:

```bash
# entry selected through assets/index/manifest.json
{
  "key": "GET /calendar/{id}",
  "summary": "get calendar id",
  "cliShape": "python api.py -m get_calendar_id --posarg <id>"
}

python api.py -m get_calendar
python api.py -m get_calendar_by_owner_id_owner_id --posarg 7
python api.py -m get_event --arg calendar_id=12 --arg start='2026-04-01T00:00:00Z' --arg end='2026-04-30T23:59:59Z'

# generic JSON body from user-provided payload
python api.py -m post_calendar --arg body='{\"title\":\"Team calendar\",\"ownerId\":7}'
python api.py -m patch_event --arg body='{\"id\":55,\"title\":\"Rescheduled demo\"}'
python api.py -m post_event --arg body='{\"calendarId\":12,\"title\":\"Planning\",\"startDate\":\"2026-04-11T10:00:00Z\",\"endDate\":\"2026-04-11T11:00:00Z\",\"users\":[1,3,4,5]}'

# export response to file
python api.py -m get_calendar_export_id --posarg 12 --arg start='2026-04-01T00:00:00Z' --arg end='2026-04-30T23:59:59Z' --arg file_name='team.ics' --output .\\team.ics

# import file into calendar
python api.py -m post_calendar_import_id --posarg 12 --file .\\team.ics
```

Notes:

- `api.py` runs the CLI command selected by the agent from the compact index.
- Use `--arg body=<json-object>` for endpoints with generic JSON request bodies.
- Use repeated `--arg key=value` for documented query parameters.
- Runtime indexes contain `key`, `summary`, and `cliShape`.
- For export without `--output`, the CLI prints JSON metadata and includes the response body as text when it is decodable.
- For event create/update, prefer passing `calendarId`, `users`, `groups`, and `notifications` in shorthand form through the CLI; it will expand them to the entity contract expected by the API.
