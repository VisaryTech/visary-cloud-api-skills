# TaskTracker API

Use this skill when you need to work with VIS TaskTracker through the generated runtime indexes and CLI wrappers shipped with the skill.

## Runtime Preflight

Before opening indexes or making API calls, verify that Python is available. If it is unavailable, stop and report that Python is required. Do not use fallback tools or handwritten HTTP requests.

Skill artifacts:

- `assets/index/manifest.json` — the only entry point into runtime indexes.
- `api.py` — the short CLI entry point from the skill root.
- `assets/odata-examples.md` — validated OData examples and common pitfalls.

Rules:

- Before any call, open `assets/index/manifest.json` first.
- Runtime indexes in `assets/index/*.json` and the `cliShape` commands derived from them are the only source of truth for agent actions.
- Use only commands and fields that exist in the runtime indexes.
- If a field or endpoint is missing in the runtime indexes, do not invent it.
- Do not invent high-level scenarios such as "create task", "change labels", or "read epic" unless they are tied to a concrete documented endpoint.
- The client always gets an access token through `client_credentials`.
- `VIS_API_BASE_URL` and `apiBaseUrl` in `~/.config/visary-cloud.json` are treated as the VIS base URL; the client calls TaskTracker at `<base_url> + "/tasktracker"`.
- `visary_cloud_tasktracker_api_base_url` or config `endpoint` can still override the fully qualified TaskTracker endpoint directly.
- OData read endpoints must exclude hidden entities by default with `Hidden eq false`; use `--include-hidden` only when reading deleted data is explicitly required.
- Domain model field names are interpreted differently by API surface: REST-oriented model fields and request parameters use `camelCase`, while OData entity fields in `$select`, `$filter`, `$expand`, and `$orderby` use `PascalCase`.
- Treat `EntryState` values as a fixed domain convention when filtering OData entities with the `State` field: `State eq 10` means open entries, `State eq 20` means closed entries.

Workflow:

1. Verify that Python is available. If it is unavailable, stop immediately.
2. Open `assets/index/manifest.json`.
3. Select the relevant compact index only through entries listed in `assets/index/manifest.json`.
4. Find the required endpoint by `key` or `summary`.
5. Take the `cliShape` field from the matched entry.
6. For OData endpoints, preserve the base command from `cliShape` and add `--odata-arg key=value` as needed. The CLI will append `Hidden eq false` to `$filter` by default.
7. Use the command from `cliShape`.
8. If the required endpoint is absent from the runtime indexes or there is no matching index entry, report that explicitly and stop.

## OData Pitfalls

- In PowerShell, wrap every `--odata-arg` in single quotes. Double quotes will expand `$select`, `$filter`, and similar names.
- OData wire field names usually use `PascalCase`, for example `ID`, `Title`, `Labels`, even when the local runtime index model shows `camelCase`.
- Treat local model examples like `projectId`, `createdAt`, `childEpics`, `hidden` as REST-style names; for OData write them as `ProjectId`, `CreatedAt`, `ChildEpics`, `Hidden`.
- Unless `--include-hidden` is passed, OData reads automatically apply `Hidden eq false`. If you pass your own `$filter`, the CLI combines it with `and Hidden eq false`.
- For collection filters, use `any(...)`, for example `Labels/any(l:l/Title eq 'Тестирование')`.
- If you need nested collection objects in the response body, add `$expand`, for example `$expand=Labels`.
- Treat `project_id` as required for project-scoped OData endpoints such as `odata_epic`, `odata_task`, `odata_board`, `odata_sprint`, and `odata_milestone`.
- For TaskTracker entry entities, use `State eq 10` for open items and `State eq 20` for closed items. When the user asks for "open tasks" or "closed tasks", prefer these explicit filters instead of leaving the state mapping implicit.
- Before inventing a complex OData filter, open `assets/odata-examples.md` and reuse a validated pattern when possible.

## EntryState Conventions

- `State eq 10` means open entries.
- `State eq 20` means closed entries.
- For user phrasing like "open tasks", "active tasks", or "not closed tasks", prefer `State eq 10`.
- For user phrasing like "closed tasks" or "completed tasks", prefer `State eq 20`.

Use the short shell entry point `api.py` from the skill root.

CLI example:

```bash
# entry selected through assets/index/manifest.json
{
  "key": "GET /Task/query/Get/{taskId}",
  "summary": "get task task id",
  "cliShape": "python api.py -m get_task_query_get_task_id --posarg <task_id>"
}

python api.py -m get_task_query_get_task_id --posarg 123

# URL-based variant when taskId is inside the link
python api.py -m get_task_query_get_task_id --task-url https://example.local/tasktracker/projects/10/tasks/123

# OData variant with explicit query options
# effective filter: (State eq 10) and Hidden eq false
python api.py -m odata_task --arg project_id=10 --odata-arg '$filter=State eq 10' --odata-arg '$select=ID,Title' --odata-arg '$top=50'

# OData variant for closed tasks
# effective filter: (State eq 20) and Hidden eq false
python api.py -m odata_task --arg project_id=10 --odata-arg '$filter=State eq 20' --odata-arg '$select=ID,Title' --odata-arg '$top=50'

# OData count for open tasks
# effective filter: (State eq 10) and Hidden eq false
python api.py -m odata_task_count --arg project_id=10 --odata-arg '$filter=State eq 10'

# OData epic filter by label title
# effective filter: (Labels/any(l:l/Title eq 'Тестирование')) and Hidden eq false
python api.py -m odata_epic --arg project_id=12 --odata-arg '$filter=Labels/any(l:l/Title eq ''Тестирование'')' --odata-arg '$select=ID,Title,Labels' --odata-arg '$expand=Labels' --odata-arg '$top=10'

# OData epic filter by label id
# effective filter: (Labels/any(l:l/ID eq 80)) and Hidden eq false
python api.py -m odata_epic_count --arg project_id=12 --odata-arg '$filter=Labels/any(l:l/ID eq 80)'

# Explicit hidden read when deleted entities are required
python api.py -m odata_task --arg project_id=10 --include-hidden --odata-arg '$filter=Hidden eq true' --odata-arg '$select=ID,Title,Hidden'
```

Notes:

- `api.py` runs the CLI command selected by the agent from the compact indexes.
- `api.py` supports `--task-url`, `--epic-url`, and `--project-url` for extracting IDs from links.
- `api.py` supports repeated `--odata-arg key=value` for OData query options.
- `api.py` supports `--include-hidden` to disable the default OData safety filter.
- For OData endpoints, supported runtime query options are `$filter`, `$select`, `$expand`, `$top`, `$skip`, `$orderby`, `$count`.
- Runtime indexes contain `key`, `summary`, and `cliShape`.
- Runtime indexes are generated from TaskTracker API descriptions; if generated artifacts and live behavior diverge, follow the shipped indexes for agent actions and report the discrepancy instead of inventing fields.
- `api.py` prints UTF-8 JSON and emits OData hints to stderr for common filter mistakes.
